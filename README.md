# TODO list

## Project description
This is a starter project to learn Rust. Within the project a basic todo list is implemented, which can be interacted with via the CLI. The user is able to make use of the following key features. 

## Key features
- [x] adding a new task to the TODO list
- [x] see details of and edit existing tasks
- [x] checking and unchecking tasks
- [x] deleteing tasks
- [x] displaying unchecked and checked tasks

**Persistence** - Furthermore the application is complemented with a csv file and read/write functions. When starting the application the last todo-list from the csv is read, when rightfully quiting the application, with "q - Enter", the current TODO-list is written into the csv-file.

**Rust principles** - Applied rust principles include ownership, borrowing, mutability, immutability and the use of crates.

## Planned changes
- [ ] Remake of the CLI output
