# TODO list

## Project description
This is a starter project to learn Rust. Within the project a basic todo list is implemented, which can be interacted with via the CLI. The user is able to make use of the following key features. Furthermore the application is complemented with a csv file and read/write functions. When starting the application the csv is read, when rightfully quiting the application with "q - Enter", the current TODO-list is written into the csv-file.
