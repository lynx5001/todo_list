# TODO list

## Project description
This is a starter project to learn Rust. Within the project a basic todo list should be implemented, which can be interacted with via the CLI. The user should be able to make use of the following key features.

## Key features
- [x] adding a new task to the TODO list
- [ ] editing existing tasks in the TODO list
- [x] checking tasks in the TODO list
- [x] viewing already checked tasks from the TODO list
- [x] displaying the current TODO list

## Current 
Currently the application allows to add a new task, and display the current TODO list. The application does not have a database, so the list can be created and interacted with during runtime. After ending the programm, all added data is lost. A database integration is planned in the future. Furthermore a frontend implementation is planned to allow easier interaction with the list

## Planned changes
- [ ] Frontend implementation
- [ ] Database integration
